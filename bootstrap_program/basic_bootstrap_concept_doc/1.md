**Don't mix with other components**   
Icon classes cannot be directly combined with other components. They should not be used along with other classes on the same element. Instead, add a nested <span> and apply the icon classes to the <span>     

**Only for use on empty elements**   
Icon classes should only be used on elements that contain no text content and have no child elements.
